A new Flutter project.

## Goal

 The objective of this tutorial is to look at how i customise Flutter Widgets to achieve my own beautiful user interface designs.

## What I Will Create

 Iâ€™m going to make a Body Mass Index Calculator. It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.
